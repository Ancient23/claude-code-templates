# React Component Generator

Create a React component for $ARGUMENTS following project conventions.

## Task

I'll help you create a complete React component by:

1. Analyzing your project structure and conventions
2. Creating component files with appropriate organization
3. Implementing the component with proper TypeScript types
4. Adding styles according to your project's styling approach
5. Creating tests for the component
6. Adding documentation and usage examples

## Process

I'll follow these steps:

1. Examine your project to understand component patterns and conventions
2. Identify the styling approach (CSS/SCSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind, etc.)
3. Determine testing frameworks and patterns
4. Create the component with appropriate file structure
5. Implement component logic, props interface, and styling
6. Add comprehensive tests
7. Document the component's usage and props

## Component Features

I can implement various component types and features:

- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Proper prop validation and defaults
- Responsive design considerations
- Accessibility (a11y) best practices
- Performance optimizations (memoization, etc.)
- Error boundaries when appropriate
- Loading and error states
- Animation and transition effects

## Component Architecture Patterns

I'll adapt to your project's component architecture:

- Atomic Design methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Feature-based organization
- Container/Presentational pattern
- Compound components
- Render props pattern
- Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
- Custom hooks for logic extraction

I'll analyze your existing components to match your project's specific patterns and conventions.
