# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a template repository for Claude Code configurations optimized for different programming languages. The repository provides ready-to-use Claude Code setups including CLAUDE.md files, custom commands, and workflow examples for popular languages.

## Repository Structure

- `common/` - Language-agnostic templates and shared configurations
- `javascript-typescript/` - Templates for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- `python/` - Templates for Python projects
- `rust/` - Templates for Rust projects (planned)
- `go/` - Templates for Go projects (planned)

Each language folder should contain:
- `README.md` - Language-specific setup and usage instructions
- `CLAUDE.md` - Language-optimized Claude Code configuration
- `.claude/commands/` - Custom commands for common tasks
- `examples/` - Sample project configurations

## Development Commands

Since this is a template repository, there are no build, test, or lint commands. The primary development activities are:

- Creating and updating template files
- Testing templates with real projects
- Maintaining documentation consistency

## Template Development Guidelines

When creating or updating templates:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain the same folder structure across all language templates
2. **Documentation**: Each template must include comprehensive README.md and CLAUDE.md files
3. **Custom Commands**: Include practical, commonly-used commands in `.claude/commands/`
4. **Examples**: Provide real-world examples that demonstrate the template's usage

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for folder names (e.g., `javascript-typescript`)
- Custom command files should be descriptive (e.g., `test.md`, `lint.md`, `git-workflow.md`)
- Example folders should describe the project type (e.g., `react-app`, `django-app`)

## Target Audience

These templates are designed for developers who want to:
- Quickly set up Claude Code for their specific programming language
- Leverage language-specific best practices
- Access pre-configured custom commands for common tasks
- Follow proven workflows for their development environment
